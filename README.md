# Smart-Irrigation-System




The ability to grow massive amounts of food in recent times has only been possible with the advent of pesticides, mechanisation, and using a lot of water. However, these practices are often unsustainable, thus ruining the environment and depleting valuable resources in the process. This project is meant to tackle water usage, as being able to pinpoint exactly where water is needed can prevent over-irrigation.Â 

The Smart Agriculture System based on IoT devices, which was previously employed in this field and supported this model, is able to monitor soil moisture and climate conditions in order to grow and yield a decent crop. from which we developed the smart irrigation concept and dataset.

This project focuses on the development of a Smart Irrigation System leveraging TinyML (TinyML is a very efficient and cost effective way to deploy ML models without SOTA architectures, this way machine learning can penetrate into different domains) technology for efficient and automated field irrigation. The goal is to predict the need for irrigation based on environmental factors such as soil moisture and temperature.This system is intended to create an automated irrigation mechanism that turns the pumping motor ON and OFF on detecting the dampness content of the earth. In this system, we are interfacing the Arduino board through, soil moisture sensor and temperature sensor.
